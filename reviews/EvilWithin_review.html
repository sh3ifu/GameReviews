    <p id = "first_block">The Evil Within is not a game for the faint of heart. She frankly does not scrimp on guts and blood, they are straight at every turn. Creepy monsters are hunting you, and not a grasp of ammo and weapons will complement to your despair. Even at the very beginning, the game already throws the player into thrash, where you have to be on the lookout every second so as not to be killed.</p>
    <h3 id = "about_the_game">About the game</h3>
    <p id = "second_block">The main character is detective Sebastian Castellanos, who, together with his companions, arrived to investigate the mass murder in a psychiatric hospital. When they arrived there, they saw a terrible massacre that was happening there. At this point, everything turns into a hellish nightmare in which you have to fight for every second of your own life, to resist hordes of monsters, while avoiding many deadly traps; relive the bloody memories of others, trying not to go crazy and in the end face the darkness, where intrigue will keep you until the very end.</p>    
    <h3 id = "minuses">Minuses</h3>
    <li>Control - this can be attributed to both not very convenient control in the game (especially on the gamepad), and dulling the main character in front of obstacles, which leading to many deaths. This is especially problematic during boss fights.</li>
    <li>Camera - is close to the character, which caused inconvenience in some moments</li>
    <h3 id = "pros">Pros</h3>
    <li>Good plot</li>
    <li>Depressing atmosphere. Everything is as it should be in such games.</li>
    <li>Hardcore gameplay with a focus on improvisation.</li>
    <li>Great design.</li>
    <p id="third_block">To get the most out of the game, I advise you to play it on a high difficulty level. Only in this way will you understand the mercilessness of a survival game, where the value of cartridges, first-aid kits and consumables is almost absolute, and monsters are ready to tear apart the slow protagonist in a moment. Mechanics does not forgive mistakes, crushes with restrictions, but always leaves a loophole for salvation. The campaign continuously delights with intense missions, gunfights and exciting boss battles. You also need to go through DLS, only with them you will receive answers to the questions of the main game, just like new questions.</p>
    <p id="fourth_block">Are you ready to deal with it and accept the challenge of this game? Precisely a challenge, since it is completely built on the philosophy of survival. Constant expectation of a frantic threat, counting and competent use of consumables and the environment, developing tactics to save and destroy the enemy. It all works here as well as ever, giving a really powerful old school experience. There are not many hard games right now without all the easy difficulty levels. And this is one of them.</p>
